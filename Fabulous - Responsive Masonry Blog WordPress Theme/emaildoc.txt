Well, Syed saab, a little historical background to the Indian talent "tsunami", as you put it: Upon his election in 1960, Jack Kennedy asked Jawaharlal Nehru how the U.S. could assist in India's development. Nehru asked for five institutions like the MIT. Kennedy offered a lot more, especially in agricultural science and technology. Consider what Prof. Panagarya of ColumbiaU, an expert on Indian economy, has to say: 
 India lags behind comparator countries in both the quantity and quality of education. Gross enrollment ratio-the proportion of those enrolled in higher education to the total population in the age group 18 to 23 years-remains around 20 per cent compared to 28 per cent in China, 36 per cent in Brazil and 55 per cent in Japan. None of the Indian degree-granting institutions appears in the top 200 institutions worldwide in the Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings. In contrast, each of Hong Kong, China, Singapore, South Korea and Japan has two or more institutions represented in these rankings.
